# Networking Protocols In OSI Layers

| OSI Layer      | Description                                                               | Common Networking Protocols       |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Application    | Layer that provides networking services to applications.                  | HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, SNMP, DNS |
| Presentation   | Translates data between the application layer and the network format.     | SSL, TLS, JPEG, MPEG              |
| Session        | Manages sessions between applications.                                   | NetBIOS, NFS, RPC                 |
| Transport      | Provides reliable data transfer services to the upper layers.             | TCP, UDP, SCTP                    |
| Network        | Determines how data is transferred between network devices.               | IP, ICMP, IGMP, IPsec             |
| Data Link      | Defines protocols for data transmission between network devices on the same network segment. | Ethernet, PPP, Switched Fabric    |
| Physical       | Concerned with transmission and reception of the unstructured raw bit stream over a physical medium. | DSL, ISDN, Cables, Fiber Optics   |
