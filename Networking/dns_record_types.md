# DNS Record Types

DNS (Domain Name System) records are used to control how your domain is resolved, each serving different purposes. Hereâ€™s an overview of different DNS record types and their functions, along with examples of how to use `nslookup` to query each type:

### A (Address) Record
- **Purpose**: Maps a domain to an IPv4 address.

```bash
nslookup example.com

# Output
Server:		8.8.8.8
Address:	8.8.8.8#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	example.com
Address: 93.184.216.34
```

### AAAA (IPv6 Address) Record
- **Purpose**: Maps a domain to an IPv6 address.

```bash
nslookup -type=aaaa ipv6.example.com`
```

### CNAME (Canonical Name) Record
- **Purpose**: Maps an alias name to a true or canonical domain name.

```bash
nslookup -type=cname www.example.com`
```

### MX (Mail Exchange) Record
- **Purpose**: Specifies mail servers responsible for a domain.

```bash
nslookup -type=mx example.com
```

### PTR (Pointer) Record
- **Purpose**: Maps an IP address to a host name for reverse DNS lookups.

```bash
nslookup -type=ptr 55.123.45.67.in-addr.arpa
```

### NS (Name Server) Record
- **Purpose**: Delegates a subdomain to a set of name servers.

```bash
nslookup -type=ns example.com
```

### TXT (Text) Record
- **Purpose**: Allows administrators to insert arbitrary text into a DNS record. Often used for verification purposes.

```bash
nslookup -type=txt example.com
```

### SRV (Service) Record
- **Purpose**: Specifies information about available services.

```bash
nslookup -type=srv _sip._tcp.example.com
```

### SOA (Start of Authority) Record
- **Purpose**: Stores essential domain information, including the primary name server, the email of the domain administrator, the domain serial number, and timers.

```bash
nslookup -type=soa example.com
```

### SPF (Sender Policy Framework) Record
- **Purpose**: Helps prevent email spoofing by specifying which mail servers are allowed to send email on behalf of your domain.
- **Note**: SPF records are now typically included within TXT records.

```bash
nslookup -type=txt example.com
```
*Look for entries starting with "v=spf1..."*

### CAA (Certification Authority Authorization) Record
- **Purpose**: Specifies which certificate authorities (CAs) are allowed to issue certificates for a domain.

```bash
nslookup -type=caa example.com
```
