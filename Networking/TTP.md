# TTP

TTP in the context of cybersecurity stands for "Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures." These terms are used to describe the behavior of cyber threat actors. Understanding TTPs is critical for cyber defense, threat analysis, and incident response. Here is what each term generally refers to:

1. **Tactics**: This describes the adversary's overall objectives or the "why" of an operation. Itâ€™s the strategic part of the approach which defines the general approach to achieve their goals during a cyberattack or series of attacks. This could include goals such as espionage, data destruction, or financial gain.

2. **Techniques**: These are the "how" of the operations, referring to the general methods the attackers use to achieve their tactical goals. This can involve various methods such as spear-phishing, exploitation of a software vulnerability, lateral movement within a network, or data encryption for ransomware.

3. **Procedures**: This represents the specific, detailed methods that adversaries use to employ techniques. These are the exact processes or steps they take when engaging in a technique, like the particular phishing email content they use, the specific malware they deploy, or the command-and-control servers they communicate with.

The categorization of TTPs is essential for cybersecurity professionals because it helps them to understand the behavior of adversaries, anticipate potential attacks, and develop defenses against them. It's a key part of threat intelligence and is used to profile threat actors, their possible intentions, and the way they conduct their operations.

Frameworks such as MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) provide a comprehensive matrix of known adversary TTPs based on real-world observations. This knowledge base is used widely in the cybersecurity industry to improve threat detection, incident response, and security policy formulation.
