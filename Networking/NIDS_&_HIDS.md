# NIDS & HIDS

Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) and Host Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS) are both essential components of network security, but they function in different scopes and have distinct mechanisms of operation:

**Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS):**

- **Scope**: NIDS monitors network traffic for all devices on a network. It analyzes the incoming and outgoing traffic from all devices to the network to detect suspicious patterns that may indicate a network or system attack.
  
- **Placement**: NIDS are usually placed at strategic points within the network to monitor traffic to and from all devices on the network. Often this means at the boundary or perimeter of the network or in front of network segments.

- **Detection Method**: NIDS typically performs analysis of passing traffic on the entire subnet and matches the traffic that is passed on the subnets to the library of known attacks. Once an attack is identified or abnormal behavior is sensed, an alert can be sent to the administrator.

- **Limitations**: Since NIDS monitors traffic at the network level, it may not be able to detect if an individual host has been compromised. Also, encrypted traffic can be a challenge for NIDS because it cannot inspect the payload of encrypted packets.

**Host Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS):**

- **Scope**: HIDS is installed on individual hosts or devices on the network (such as a server, workstation, or endpoint device) and monitors system files, logs, and other internal activities of that host.

- **Placement**: HIDS is placed directly on the host computer that it is monitoring. It has the advantage of having access to detailed information about the computerâ€™s operating system and its activities.

- **Detection Method**: HIDS typically looks for signs of a system being compromised, such as changes to system files or registry settings, failed log-in attempts, and other activities that might indicate a security breach.

- **Limitations**: HIDS only provides information about the individual host that it is installed on, so it does not have visibility into broader network events. Deployment and maintenance can be more complex since it requires installing the software on each host system you want to monitor.

**Comparison Summary:**

- NIDS is about watching the traffic on the network, looking for suspicious activities that could represent attacks from outside the host network.
- HIDS is about monitoring the behavior on an individual host, watching for changes or activities that could indicate a compromise.

Many organizations deploy both NIDS and HIDS to get a more complete picture of their network security, combining the benefits of broad network monitoring with the detailed analysis of individual host activity.
