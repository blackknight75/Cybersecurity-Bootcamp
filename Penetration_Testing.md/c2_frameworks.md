# C2 Frameworks

**Command and Control (C2) frameworks** are tools used primarily in cybersecurity, specifically in the context of offensive security, penetration testing, and red team operations. They enable attackers or security professionals to establish and maintain communication with compromised systems within a target network. These frameworks facilitate the remote control of these systems, allowing the execution of commands, exfiltration of data, and deployment of further payloads.

C2 frameworks are crucial for simulating advanced persistent threat (APT) activities in a controlled manner to test an organization's defenses, such as detection capabilities and response protocols. They provide a structured and efficient way to manage the interactions with multiple compromised systems simultaneously.

### Common C2 Frameworks and Tools

Here are ten common C2 frameworks and tools used in cybersecurity:

1. **Cobalt Strike** - A commercial, full-featured penetration testing tool used for executing targeted attacks. It simulates a multitude of threat actor behaviors and is known for its robust set of capabilities that include spear phishing and web drive-bys.

2. **Metasploit** - An open-source project that provides a public resource for researching security vulnerabilities and developing code. Its framework allows users to develop and execute exploit code against a remote target machine.

3. **Empire** - A post-exploitation framework that is widely used due to its PowerShell and Python capabilities, allowing for the exploitation of Windows, Mac OS, and Linux systems.

4. **Pupy** - An open-source, cross-platform (Windows, Linux, OSX, Android) remote administration and post-exploitation tool, mainly written in Python. It enables broad control over a local or remote device.

5. **Beacon** - Often a part of the Cobalt Strike suite; it is a lightweight C2 agent designed to execute PowerShell scripts, deliver files, and spawn other processes.

6. **C2 Matrix** - A tool that helps users choose among the different command and control frameworks available. It's a comprehensive matrix that categorizes and evaluates numerous C2 frameworks.

7. **Koadic** - An open-source Windows post-exploitation rootkit similar to other Unix-based shells. It primarily uses Windows Script Host (JScript/VBScript) to gain persistence.

8. **Sliver** - A general-purpose cross-platform implant framework that supports C2 over Mutual-TLS, HTTP(S), and DNS. It is often used in red team operations.

9. **Covenant** - A .NET command and control framework that aims to highlight the attack capabilities of .NET. It provides a robust web-based interface and has been developed with a modular approach to implants.

10. **Merlin** - A cross-platform post-exploitation HTTP/2 Command & Control server and agent written in Go. It is designed to be stealthy and evade network detection.

These tools vary significantly in terms of their capabilities, the level of stealth they offer, and the specific systems they target. Using these frameworks requires substantial knowledge of network security, threat emulation, and often a legal framework (such as permission from the network owner) to ensure ethical use in testing and improving network defenses.
