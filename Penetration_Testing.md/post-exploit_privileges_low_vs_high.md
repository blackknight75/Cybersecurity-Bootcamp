# Post Exploit Privileges Low vs. High

During the post-exploitation phase of a cyber attack or penetration testing, the terms **low privilege** and **high privilege** refer to the levels of access or permissions that an account or process has on a compromised system. Understanding the distinction between these levels is crucial for both attackers and defenders to navigate the security environment effectively.

### Low Privilege

**Low privilege** accounts have restricted permissions, typically limited to actions necessary for standard users. These accounts cannot make significant changes to the system's core settings or access sensitive data outside of the user's scope. Here are some characteristics of low privilege accounts:

- **Limited System Changes:** Can only modify user-level settings and data. Cannot install software, modify system settings, or access other users' data.
- **Minimal Access to Sensitive Data:** Typically restricted to accessing data that belongs to the user or is publicly accessible on the system.
- **User Level Applications:** Limited to running applications that do not require administrative rights.

In the context of a cyber attack, an attacker with access via a low privilege account will typically seek ways to escalate their privileges to achieve their objectives, whether that's data exfiltration, system damage, or lateral movement within the network.

### High Privilege

**High privilege** accounts have extensive permissions that allow them to make significant changes to the system. This usually includes administrative or root-level access. Characteristics of high privilege accounts include:

- **Complete System Control:** Can change any system setting, including security configurations, software installations, and modifications to critical system files.
- **Access to All Data:** Capable of accessing all data stored on the system, including data belonging to other users and sensitive system data.
- **Administrative Tools and Operations:** Can run and interact with any application or service on the system, regardless of its access requirements.

High privilege accounts are highly sought after in various types of cyber attacks because they allow broad control over the system and provide the means to achieve almost any malicious goal.

### Privilege Escalation

**Privilege escalation** is the process by which an attacker, initially operating under a low privilege context, gains higher-level privileges, typically equivalent to administrative access. This can be achieved through various methods, such as exploiting system vulnerabilities, configuration errors, or leveraging stolen credentials.

Privilege escalation is a critical step in many cyber attacks, as it allows an initially limited intrusion to expand into a full compromise of the system. For defenders, protecting against privilege escalation involves a combination of patch management, least privilege policies, and monitoring for unusual activity indicative of such attacks.
