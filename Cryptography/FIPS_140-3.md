# FIPS 140-3

FIPS 140-3 is a U.S. government standard that details the security requirements for cryptographic modules that protect sensitive information. Standing for Federal Information Processing Standard, it is published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

FIPS 140-3 is an updated version of FIPS 140-2 and includes several new areas of cryptographic security, including but not limited to:

Enhanced physical security requirements
Stronger mechanisms for authentication and role-based access control to cryptographic modules
Improved requirements for mitigating non-invasive attacks (such as side-channel attacks)
Updated and more stringent documentation requirements
The primary purpose of FIPS 140-3 is to assure users that a cryptographic module meets certain standards for security and can be used in a wide range of security applications and sensitive environments, including government agencies and regulated industries that collect, store, transfer, share, and disseminate sensitive but unclassified (SBU) information.

This standard is also relevant for companies that sell cryptographic products to the U.S. government, as adherence to this standard is often a prerequisite. FIPS 140-3 came into effect on September 22, 2019, and there was a transition period for compliance from FIPS 140-2 to FIPS 140-3 standards.

### FIPS 140-3 vs FIPS 140-2

1. **Timeline**: FIPS 140-2 was in effect from May 25, 2001, until September 21, 2019. FIPS 140-3 became effective on September 22, 2019.

2. **Physical Security**: FIPS 140-3 introduces new requirements for physical security as well as new types of physical security mechanisms. It also places stricter requirements on the physical tamper-evidence and tamper-response capabilities of security modules.

3. **Cryptographic Module Ports and Interfaces (CMPI)**: FIPS 140-3 includes a new section on CMPI which provides requirements and guidance for ports and interfaces on cryptographic modules, which was not separately addressed in FIPS 140-2.

4. **Electromagnetic Interference/Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMI/EMC)**: FIPS 140-3 introduces new requirements for EMI/EMC based on existing international standards, which FIPS 140-2 did not specifically address.

5. **Self-Tests**: The self-testing requirements in FIPS 140-3 are more prescriptive. The standard defines the types of tests that must be run and the minimum frequency for the tests.

6. **Operating Environments**: FIPS 140-3 introduces the concept of a multi-chip standalone (MCS) cryptographic module and a split multi-chip embedded (SME) cryptographic module.

7. **Software/Firmware Security**: FIPS 140-3 has enhanced requirements for software and firmware security, including the establishment of a security life cycle for cryptographic modules.

8. **Mitigation of Other Attacks**: FIPS 140-3 includes requirements to protect against non-invasive attacks such as differential power analysis (DPA) and fault injection attacks, which were not specifically addressed in FIPS 140-2.

9. **Security Level Enhancements**: While FIPS 140-2 defined four levels of security, FIPS 140-3 also defines four levels but with some enhanced requirements at each level, making it more difficult for modules to achieve higher security levels.

10. **Documentation**: FIPS 140-3 requires more detailed documentation for the cryptographic modules, including a detailed specification of the security policies enforced by the module.

In essence, FIPS 140-3 represents a modernization and strengthening of the cryptographic module security standards, reflecting the advances in cryptography and the increased understanding of potential attack vectors on cryptographic modules. It is aimed at making cryptographic modules more resilient against physical and logical attacks.
