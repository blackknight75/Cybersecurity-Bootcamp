# FIPS 140-3

FIPS 140-3 is a U.S. government standard that details the security requirements for cryptographic modules that protect sensitive information. Standing for Federal Information Processing Standard, it is published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

FIPS 140-3 is an updated version of FIPS 140-2 and includes several new areas of cryptographic security, including but not limited to:

Enhanced physical security requirements
Stronger mechanisms for authentication and role-based access control to cryptographic modules
Improved requirements for mitigating non-invasive attacks (such as side-channel attacks)
Updated and more stringent documentation requirements
The primary purpose of FIPS 140-3 is to assure users that a cryptographic module meets certain standards for security and can be used in a wide range of security applications and sensitive environments, including government agencies and regulated industries that collect, store, transfer, share, and disseminate sensitive but unclassified (SBU) information.

This standard is also relevant for companies that sell cryptographic products to the U.S. government, as adherence to this standard is often a prerequisite. FIPS 140-3 came into effect on September 22, 2019, and there was a transition period for compliance from FIPS 140-2 to FIPS 140-3 standards.
