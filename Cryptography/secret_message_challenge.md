**Classified Briefing:** *February 20th 6:07 PM*  
  
Agents,  
  
In the shadows of the digital realm, a cryptic message has been intercepted. Encrypted with layers of complexity, this document holds secrets that could tilt the balance of power. Your mission, should you decide to embark upon it, involves deciphering the unknown - unlocking the encrypted note that has been securely passed to you.

**Objective:**  
Your task is to penetrate the veil of secrecy by identifying the correct key and Initialization Vector (IV). These are the critical pieces needed to decrypt the note and reveal its hidden message.

We were given these 3 strings. The meaning and purpose of these strings are currently unknown, but intelligence suggests they are imperative for the success of your operation. You will need to employ all available resources and expertise to uncover their significance and how they can be leveraged to achieve your objectives.

The Research & Development wing, in anticipation of such encrypted challenges, has engineered a groundbreaking tool designed to assist in the decryption process. However, this tool awaits your prowess to fulfill its purpose. Without the Key and IV, it remains a dormant arsenal in our intelligence toolkit.

This message will self-destruct in five seconds. Good luck, Agent. The fate of the mission rests in your hands. :dark_sunglasses::briefcase::unlock:
