# CEPH Cluster

A Ceph cluster is a distributed storage system that provides an interface for object, block, and file-level storage. Ceph aims to be completely distributed without a single point of failure, scalable to the exabyte level, and freely available. It is designed to be self-healing and self-managing, with the goal of minimizing administration time and other costs.

Here's how Ceph operates:

Object Storage: Ceph stores data as objects within storage pools. Using the CRUSH (Controlled Replication Under Scalable Hashing) algorithm, Ceph calculates which placement group should contain the object, and further calculates which Ceph node (called OSDs or Object Storage Daemons) should store the placement group.

Block Storage: Ceph can provide block storage capabilities, such as virtual disks to virtual machines or as a bare metal disk partition. It does this through its RADOS Block Device (RBD), which stripes a block device across multiple distributed object store data servers seamlessly.

File System: Ceph's file system (Ceph FS) runs on top of the same object storage system (RADOS) and provides features like snapshots and replication. It is POSIX-compliant and can serve many clients simultaneously thanks to its distributed nature.

Scalability: The system is designed to be highly scalable, both in terms of capacity and performance. It can scale from a few terabytes to multiple petabytes easily, and because of its distributed nature, it can also scale horizontally.

Reliability: Redundancy is a key feature of Ceph, and data is replicated across multiple nodes to ensure durability and high availability. Should a node fail, Ceph will re-replicate the data elsewhere to maintain the redundancy level.

Management: Ceph clusters are designed to be self-managing, with components that continuously monitor the health and performance of each other and adjust the distribution of data accordingly.
