To address the issue highlighted by the error message and safely add the new host key to your known_hosts file, you should first verify the authenticity of the key. This involves confirming that the SHA256:hN+fxcFyh+f8S7LsskAmI+H2ZG0qJ5PTN0YtWlELJnA fingerprint matches the host key fingerprint of the server you're attempting to connect to. Typically, this verification is done by checking with the server administrator or through some other secure channel to ensure that you're not subject to a man-in-the-middle attack.

Once you've verified the host key is legitimate, you have two options to resolve the issue:

Option 1: Manually Add the Host Key
This method involves manually editing the known_hosts file to add the new host key. However, because SSH does not provide a straightforward command to directly add a new host key to the known_hosts file, this method is less commonly recommended for most users. It's easier and safer to let SSH handle the addition of host keys automatically, as described in Option 2.

Option 2: Remove the Offending Key and Reconnect
This is the recommended approach because it allows SSH to automatically handle the verification and addition of the new host key. To do this, follow these steps:

Remove the Offending Key: First, remove the existing key entry that is causing the conflict. The error message you received indicates the offending key is on line 27 of your known_hosts file. Open a PowerShell or Command Prompt window and use the following command to remove the specified entry:

```bash
ssh-keygen -f "C:\Users\<user>\.ssh\known_hosts" -R "server_ip_address"
```
